How to run this program?

Run this just like any simple java program. 

Which IDE is used for development?

Eclipse.

Where is the input file? Should I change the input file path before running?

Yes!

1. Go to ReadFileAndProcess.java file

2. The default input file is given at the below bath.
   You must change the inputPath1 before running this program.
   It depends where the project is located.
   
   Recommended: Save the project in a workspace and give the path of the workspace in the string inputPath1.

   String inputPath1 = "/Users/***********/Documents/WorkspaceGalaxyGuide/";
   String inputPath2 = "Problem3Java8/input/";
   String inputFileName = "input.txt";

3. The inputPath2 and inputFileName can remain the same for running the default input file.

Where is the output file? Should I change the output file path before running?

Yes!

1. Go to ReadFileAndProcess.java file

2. The default output file is given at the below bath.
   You must change the outputPath1 before running this program.
   It depends where the project is located.
   
   Recommended: Save the project in a workspace and give the path of the workspace in the string outputPath1.

   String outputPath1 = "/Users/***********/Documents/WorkspaceGalaxyGuide/";
   String outputPath2 = "Problem3Java8/output/";
   String outputFileName = "output.txt";

3. The outPath2 and outputFileName can remain the same for the default location.

Important:

Variables inputPath1 and outputPath1 should be changed to where the project is saved in your machine. 
Otherwise you will encounter NoSuchFileException.
