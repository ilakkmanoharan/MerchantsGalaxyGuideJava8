You can test for various input in two ways:

1.You can use input from files 
2. And/Or use the test class: ParameterizedTest.

if you are using the input files, please change the path of the input files in the ReadFileAndProcess.java as given in the instructions.

Please feel free to delete the output file which is already generated in the output folder and test again.

I have added few tests to the ParameterizedTest, please feel free to add additional tests.

There are 2 Parameterized tests:

1.ParameterizedTest_CalculateTotalCredits.java 

We are the testing the CalculateTotalCredits(String galaticUnit) method.
The input is a list of strings. Output is the total credit in double

Example:
Input: Galatic unit "pish tegj glob glob" is broken into list of strings: ["pish", "tegj", "glob", "glob"]
Output is 42.

2.ParameterizedTest_ProcessRomanNumeral.java 

We are the testing the ProcessRomanNumeral(String galaticNumeralPart) method.
The input is a roman numeral part of galatic unit in String. Output is the credit of numeral part in double

Example:
Input: "II"
Output: 2
